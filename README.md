# Number Guessing Game 🎯

## 📖 Description
The Number Guessing Game is a simple Java console-based application where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.  
The user tries to guess the number, and the program provides hints such as **"Too High"** or **"Too Low"** until the correct number is guessed.

This project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, user input handling, and random number generation in Java.
